# CourseKata

[CourseKata](https://coursekata.org) was founded in 2017 by a group of learning scientists at UCLA and Cal State LA with a shared interest in understanding and improving how students learn things that are hard to learn. Our initial focus is on the teaching and learning of introductory statistics and data science. But our longer-term agenda is to make research on teaching and learning more relevant and more effective for improving important learning outcomes for all students.
